# Truck-BT
Forklift-project to show off at a meeting
 with Toyoya Material Handling

Goal:<
To make a machine that picks up an object if it's in the machines way and moves it, lower it down and drive away.

Includes:
6V engine to drive forward and backwards.
Ultra-Sonic Sensor to sense obstacles in front of forks.
Micro-Servo to raise and lower forks.
Motorcontroller to be able to run current both directions through engine.
Arduino Nano, packed with code, center of the project.
9V-battery to power engine with 6V, and nano with 5V.
3.7V Li-Po LG G3 battery to power servo and sensor.
Solderingplate to make the build permanent.

If time is available: 
Mount LEDs to indicate which way it's heading, blue(spot) and white LED

For the future: 
Attach another servo and make the thing mid-steering, and sense where the next object is.
